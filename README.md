# LEO-DB - A Python based database software

-> Hello, I am Malay Bhavsar. I have developed a database software entirely written in pure Python.<br/><br/>
-> It all started back on 7th September 2020, when I started learning about database. I didn't quiet undestood it. So I came up with a solution that why don't I make a database software of my own! Which can help me understand and learn together.<br/><br/>
-> It's previous versions had only basic functionalities and was not at all efficient.<br/><br/>

# ROOT - The base of everything
<br/>
-> We all know that if you have strong roots, then you stand strong! Thus here it is LEO-DB-ROOT<br/><br/>
-> LEO-DB-ROOT is a commandline database software in which the tasks will be performed using commands!<br/><br/>
-> All the Commands are listed in command_ROOT.txt file.<br/><br/>
<b>-> Features:</b><br/><br/>
            :> Supports CSV files. (IMPORT & EXPORT command)<br/>

            :> It is Fast and Reliable.<br/>
